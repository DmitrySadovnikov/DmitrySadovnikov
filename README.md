### Hi there! 👋

I'm a Software Engineer in Melbourne, Australia.

## What I do

- 💻 Work at SEEK using Ruby, TypeScript, and React
- 🚀 Run [Botly](https://botly.app) - my Telegram bot project
- ☁️ Use AWS and Terraform for cloud stuff
- 📱 Learning React Native for mobile apps

## My Botly bots

- [AWSPro](https://aws.botly.app): Helps with AWS exam prep
- [Grammar Checker](https://grammar.botly.app): Fixes text errors
- [Stickers](https://stickers.botly.app): Makes custom stickers
- [Imagine](https://imagine.botly.app): Creates AI images

## Cool stuff I've done

Built a system for lots of users that only costs $1/month on AWS!

## When I'm not coding

I play tennis, run, cycle, bake bread, read non-fiction books, and love to travel.
